[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) is a fully managed, serverless, key-value NoSQL database designed to run high-performance applications at any scale. DynamoDB offers built-in security, continuous backups, automated multi-region replication, in-memory caching, and data export tools.

The connector provides the capability to programatically handle AWS DynamoDB related operations.
